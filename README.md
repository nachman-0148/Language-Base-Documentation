# Singularity: The Language Base

Singularity is a programming language designed to express sequences of operations and complex logic in a concise, vector-based syntax. It focuses on clarity and direct representation of actions, making it ideal for defining workflows, automating tasks, and creating reactive systems.

## Key Features

* **Function Vectors:** Define sequences of operations as ordered lists of functions.
* **JSON-based Parameters:** Pass complex, structured data to functions using familiar JSON objects.
* **Human-Readable Syntax:** Aims for a syntax that is intuitive and easy to understand at a glance.
* **JavaScript Transpilation:** Programs written in Singularity are transpiled into standard JavaScript, allowing for broad compatibility and execution in any JavaScript environment (browsers, Node.js, etc.).

## Basic Concepts

### Function Vectors

In Singularity, programs are primarily composed of **function vectors**, represented by square brackets `[]`. Each element within a function vector is a function call.

```singularity
[func1, func2, func3]
